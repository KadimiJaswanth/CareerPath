## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started: Running Locally

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18 or later recommended)
- `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm` as your package manager.

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables

You'll need a Google AI API key for the generative AI features to work.

1.  Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
2.  Obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
3.  Add the key to your `.env` file:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Application

This project requires two separate development servers to run concurrently: one for the Next.js frontend and another for the Genkit AI flows.

1.  **Start the Next.js dev server:**
    Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the main web application, usually on `http://localhost:9002`.

2.  **Start the Genkit dev server:**
    Open a **second terminal** and run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    This starts the local server that runs your AI flows. The Next.js application communicates with this server.

Once both servers are running, you can open your browser to `http://localhost:9002` to see the application in action.
